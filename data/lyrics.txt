Your veins like gasoline pipes
heart’s V8 engine running high
When the big turtle machine
crawls on its death bed
promises are set aside

Needless to say, needles sway
life in too tired arms
When the big dam is leaking
the big dam is leaking
leaking into tired arms

So, bring your Bible, bring your diary
Leave your unborn at the door
Bring your Bible, bring your darlings now
Bring your records, bring your loss

Your mind’s show’s a no go
but your heart’s engine’s running high
When the big turtle machine 
crawls on its death bed
punishment are set aside

Bring your Bible, bring your diary
Leave your unborn at the door
Bring your Bible, bring your darlings now
Bring your records, bring your loss

Tell me your pains, says the doc
Tell me your worries, says the shrink
Tell me your dreams, says the banker and the means and the dove Lord high above

Tell me your pains, says the doc
Tell me your worries, says the shrink
Tell me your dreams, says the banker and the means and the dove Lord high above

Bring your Bible, bring your diary
Leave your unborn at the door
Bring your Bible, bring your darlings now
Bring your records, bring your loss

Kill your Bible, kill your diary
Collect your unborn at the door
Kill your Bible, kill your darlings now
Kill your records, kill your loss
