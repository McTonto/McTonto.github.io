[Your veins like gasoline pipes]
heart’s V8 engine running high
When the big turtle machine
crawls on its death bed
[promises are set aside]

[Needless to say, needles sway]
life in too tired arms
When the big dam is leaking
the big dam is leaking
leaking into tired arms

[So, bring your Bible, bring your diary]
Leave your unborn at the door
[Bring your Bible, bring your darlings now
Bring your records, bring your loss]
